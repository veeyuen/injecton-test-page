    This is a controlled diff demo page for the Yureeka pipeline. It exists only to validate that URL injection,
    fetching, deterministic number extraction, and Diff Panel V2 all work end-to-end. The statements below are
    intentionally simple and written in plain text so the scraper and extractor can reliably detect values, units,
    and nearby semantic cues like “global”, “sales”, “market share”, and forecast horizons.

    <p>
    Global EV sales in 2024 were 23.1 million units.    
    By 2030, global EV sales are projected to reach 40.7 million units, representing a 42% market share.

    <p>
    For a diff test, change only ONE number between runs (for example, change “18.5” to “20.0”) while keeping
    the rest of the text the same. Do not remove text, and keep the units the same (“million units”).
